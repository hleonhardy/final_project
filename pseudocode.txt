Pseudocode for Black Box Game final project:




Section 1: Set up the grid:

	i) The total grid will be a 9x9 
	ii) The inner 7x7 grid will be the “playing space”
	iii) All the spaces on the edge will be “edge spaces” 
		-Edge spaces will be labeled with coordinates
		-Edge space corners will not be labeled
	iv) The inner 5x5 grid will be the “placement space”
	v) The space in-between the edge spaces and the 7x7 playing space will be called “outside spaces”
	vi) Marbles can only be placed inside the placement space- NOT in edge spaces or outside spaces




Section 2: Player 1’s turn:

	i) Ask player 1 where they would like to place their marbles
		-if they try to place their marbles outside the placement space, they will be prompted to try again
	ii) Player 1 will place 3 marbles in the placement space
	



Section 3: Player 2’s turn:

	A) Ask player 1 to choose an edge space to send the laser beam through
	B) Establish direction-this is based on which side the edge space is on
		-For example, if they choose an edge space on the left hand side, the direction will be to the right.
	C) Move forward in direction one space to the first playing space (the first space in the playing space grid)
	

	Subsection: “Laser’s turn”: laser moves inside the grid until it reaches the edge 


		D) Check the diagonal spaces that are forward in direction (the two spaces adjacent to one space forward)
			-If both diagonals are an outside space:
				-Move laser position forward in direction twice (it will end up in an edge space)
				-The “Laser’s turn” immediately ends (See part G)
			-If both diagonal spaces are occupied by a marble:
				-Computer puts the laser back in its original space (the space it came from)
				 (No matter where the third marble is, the laser will always end up back in the space where it started)
				-The “laser’s turn” immediately ends (See part G) 
			-If only one diagonal space is occupied:
				-Direction gets changed to the opposite of which diagonal the marble is in
				 (if the diagonal is forward and to the right, the direction will be changed to left, etc)
				-Go back to part D) 
			-If no diagonal spaces are occupied, move on to part F)
		F) Check space directly forward in direction
			-If this space is occupied by a marble:
				-This is a reflection, so similarly to when both diagonals are occupied, laser will always end up where it started
				-Computer puts the laser back in its original space
				-The “laser’s turn” immediately ends (See part G)
			-If this space is not occupied
				-Laser moves forward in direction one space
				-Go back to part D)

	G) When the Laser’s turn is over:
		-Computer adds one turn to the total number of laser turns. This is player 2’s total score. 
		-Computer asks player two if they would like to either shoot another beam or guess where the marbles are.
			-If they choose to shoot another beam, repeat section 3 starting at part A).
			-If they choose to guess where the marbles are, see part H).

	H) Guessing where the marbles are:
		-Player two enters the coordinates of the marbles, computer checks to see if there are marbles there
			-If player two has guessed any of the marbles incorrectly, 2 points per incorrect marble are added to player 2’s score 
				-Computer will ask if they want to continue guessing or shoot another beam
					-If they shoot another beam, start from section 3 part A)
					-If they continue guessing, go back to the beginning of part H)
			-If player enters the marbles correctly, no points will be added to the score, move on to section 4.




Section 4: When player 2 ends their turn:

	i) Player 2 now has a total score (number of lasers fired plus 2 points per any incorrectly guessed marble position) 
	ii) Player 2 and player 1 will switch roles, starting with player 2 being asked to place the marbles (section 2).
	iii) Player 1 will guess where the marbles are, and their total score will be recorded (section 3)
	iv) Player 1 and player 2’s scores will be compared-whoever has the lowest score will be the winner!
